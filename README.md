# terra
Welcome to 'terra'V2, this version has a cleaner look and debug feature. This application has been developed to enable users a local way to swap and manage different versions of Terraform.

To use this, follow the setup instructions bellow.

### Setup

> `git clone https://github.com/SeanMcCann93/terra.git`
> `cd ./terra`
> `bash addTERRA.sh`

This should install 'terra' as an executable. Try 'terra -h'.
If you need to debug what is happening you can use `export terraDebug="true"`
